# AirQuality-Prediction
This project analyzes air quality data to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) using Python and machine learning. Using sensor readings like CO, NOx, NO2, O3, temperature, humidity, and more, a Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict AQI categories with an accuracy of ~85%.
It includes data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning to extract insights about air pollution.

Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Converted numeric values, handled missing data.

Visualizations:

- Distribution of O3 and CO sensor readings

- AQI category counts

- Feature importance from the Random Forest model

- Correlation heatmap

- AQI trends by month

Key Insights

- CO, NOx, and NO2 are the most important factors affecting AQI.

- Most days fall under Good or Moderate AQI categories.

- Seasonal trends indicate AQI worsens in certain months.

- Correlation analysis shows relationships between pollutants and air quality.

The dataset ('air_quality.csv') is included in this repository.
