# AirQuality-Prediction
This project analyzes air quality data to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) using Python and machine learning. Using sensor readings like CO, NOx, NO2, O3, temperature, humidity, and more, a Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict AQI categories with an accuracy of ~85%.
